# Portfolio_Projects
Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! This repository contains a collection of my data analysis projects, showcasing my skills in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and data visualization. These projects are built using tools like Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and SQL.


Project Title: Ad-Hoc Data Analysis with SQL and Python

Project Description:

This project demonstrates the ability to perform ad-hoc data analysis using a combination of SQL and Python. 

It involves:
Data Exploration: Using SQL queries to extract and explore relevant data from a given dataset.
Data Wrangling: Cleaning and transforming the data as needed for analysis.
Data Analysis: Answering 10 specific questions about the data using SQL queries[Questions are mentioned in the notebook iself].
Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib to present the analysis results in a clear and concise manner.
Key Skills Demonstrated:

SQL: Proficiency in writing SQL queries for data extraction, filtering, aggregation, and joining.
Python: Familiarity with Python for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
Data Analysis: Ability to formulate and answer relevant questions about the data.
Data Visualization: Skill in creating effective and informative visualizations using Matplotlib.
Problem-solving: Ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions.




Project Title: Movie Correlation Analysis with Python

Project Description:

This project explores correlations between various features of movies using Python. It involves:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Loading a dataset containing movie information (e.g., IMDB, TMDb) and cleaning the data to handle missing values, inconsistencies, and irrelevant features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution of different features, identify potential relationships, and gain insights into the movie industry.
Correlation Analysis: Calculating correlation coefficients between different movie features using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy.
Data Visualization: Creating insightful visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to represent the correlations between features. These visualizations could include scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.
Interpretation and Insights: Analyzing the correlation results to identify significant relationships between movie features, such as the relationship between budget and revenue, user ratings and popularity, or genre and profitability.
Key Skills Demonstrated:

Python: Proficiency in using Python for data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
Data Analysis: Ability to perform exploratory data analysis, calculate correlations, and interpret the results.
Data Visualization: Skill in creating effective and informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Problem-solving: Ability to analyze data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions.
Domain Knowledge: Understanding of the movie industry and its key features.





Here's a project description for a Sales Market Report using Excel, DAX measures, and Pivot Tables:

Project Title: Sales Market Report Analysis with Excel

Project Description:

This project focuses on analyzing sales data using Excel, with a specific emphasis on creating insightful reports using DAX measures and Pivot Tables.

Data Preparation: Loading and cleaning sales data in Excel, handling missing values and inconsistencies.
DAX Measure Creation: Creating custom DAX measures to calculate key performance indicators (KPIs) such as:
Net Sales
Net Sales 19,20,21
Target etc.
Pivot Table Creation: Building interactive Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze the sales data. These Pivot Tables will utilize the created DAX measures to provide dynamic and insightful views into sales performance.
Report Creation: Consolidating the analysis results, DAX measures, Pivot Tables, and visualizations into a comprehensive sales market report.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
Excel Proficiency: Advanced Excel skills, including data manipulation, formula creation, and Pivot Table creation.
DAX: Understanding and application of DAX for creating custom calculations and measures.
Data Analysis: Ability to analyze sales data, identify trends, and calculate key performance indicators.
